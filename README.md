Steps to Use:
1. Save the script to a .py file.
2. Ensure the data.csv file exists in the same directory (or update the path to the file in the csv_file variable).
3. Install the required library by running pip install python-docx if not already installed.
4. Run the script.
5. The script will create a folder named output_docs (if it doesn't exist) and save the Word documents there. Each document will be named after the corresponding value in the name column.
